# Authentication and JWT

1. `POST /users` should accept `password` field and before save replace it with **hash** (use [bcrypt package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt) or its equivalent like `bcryptjs`).
2. Implement `POST /login` method which accepts **JSON** with `login` and `password` and returns **JWT** token in response body: `{ token: <jwt_token> }` (use [jsonwebtoken package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken)).
3. **JWT** token should contain `userId` and `login` in a **payload**.
4. Secret that used for signing the token should be stored in `.env` file.
5. For all client requests the **JWT** token should be added in HTTP `Authorization` header to all requests that requires authentication. HTTP authentication must follow `Bearer` scheme, e.g.:
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <jwt_token>
  ```
6. Proxy all the requests (except `/login`) and check that HTTP `Authorization` header has the correct value of **JWT** token.
7. In case of the HTTP `Authorization` header in the request is absent or invalid or doesnâ€™t follow `Bearer` scheme, further router method execution should be stopped and lead to response with HTTP **401** code (Unauthorized error) and the corresponding error message.
8. **Add admin user to DB** on service start with `login = admin` and `password = admin`.
